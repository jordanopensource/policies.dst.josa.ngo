# Overview

This framework guides your organization to agree on well-defined objectives for strategy and security of information. A set of digital security policies aimed to help you improve your digital safety and resiliency, and also promote digital rights and privacy for all, in Jordan and around the globe.

Information security focuses on three main objectives:

- `Confidentiality` — considers proper authorization to access and use assets
- `Integrity` — considers data integrity and authenticity
- `Availability` — considers ease of access to information or systems when necessary

Grouped and categorized you will find a set of policies that you may use as a basis to develop your own tailored set of policies.

A `Digital Security Policy` or `Policy` in this context identifies the rules and procedures for all individuals accessing and using an organization's IT assets and resources. Effective security is ensured by deploying and enforcing of such policies in the workplace and for all employees.

Every `Policy` consists of four different sections:

- `Objectives` - what the policy aims to accomplish?
- `Scope` - who, what, and when this policy applies.
- `Goals` - list of goals needed to accomplish our desired aims.
- `Compliance` - list of responsibilities for compliance and actions to be taken in the event of noncompliance.

Every policy is denoted as `x.y.z` where:

- `x` is the category of the digital policy
- `y` is the the group of policies in that category
- `z` is the the number of that policy in that group
